        <h2>Ways You Can Help</h2>
        <p> Helping street dogs requires compassion, commitment, and community action. You can begin by offering them regular food, fresh water, and a safe place to rest, which can make a big difference in their daily survival. If you notice a dog in distress—whether due to injury, illness, or neglect—reach out to animal rescue groups or veterinary professionals who can provide proper care. Vaccinations and sterilization are critical measures to prevent the spread of diseases and control the growing population of street dogs. Consider fostering dogs temporarily, offering them shelter and socialization until they find permanent homes. Adoption is another impactful way to provide a street dog with a forever home, giving them a life filled with security and love. You can also volunteer with or donate to organizations that rescue and rehabilitate street dogs, or spread awareness to encourage others to take action. Each small effort contributes to creating a more compassionate environment for street dogs.</p>
